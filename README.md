# I created an ESX FiveM server base.

## DISCLAIMER
### Before we begin, I want to specify that the ZIP file I uploaded only contains the resources and the server.cfg configuration file, so, you'll need to create a server, that's NOT included in the archive, following the steps on the cfx.re website.
